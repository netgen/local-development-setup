Set up Memcached distributed memory object caching system
=========================================================

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary
data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or
page rendering. Itâ€™s used as a backend for persistent cache
implementation on some older projects (newer projects mostly use
`Redis <../redis>`__).

1 Install
---------

Execute on the command line:

.. code:: console

   sudo apt install memcached
   sudo apt install libmemcached-tools

You also need to install PHP extension:

.. code:: console

   sudo apt install php-memcached

2 Start
-------

2.1 Start automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute on the command line:

.. code:: console

   sudo systemctl enable memcached

This will start the server and set it up to start automatically after a
reboot.

To stop the server and prevent it from running after a reboot, execute:

.. code:: console

   sudo systemctl disable memcached

2.2 Start manually when needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Memcached is a service in Ubuntu so it can be started and stoped as
regular services:

.. code:: console

   sudo service memcached start
   sudo service memcached stop
   sudo service memcached restart
   sudo service memcached status

3 Test
------

To test if the ``memcached`` server is running, execute:

.. code:: console

   ps aux | grep memcached

You should see its process there, altogether with the port on which it
listens to (default ``11211``).

Then you can ``telnet`` to it with:

.. code:: console

   telnet localhost 11211
