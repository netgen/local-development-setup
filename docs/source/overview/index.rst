Netgenâ€™s Local Development Setup
================================

This is a guide on setting up modern web development environment with
PHP on your local Mac or Linux machine, without using any kind of
virtualization. Web server configurations for Symfony and eZ Platform /
Ibexa CMS are provided out of the box, but the setup is not limited to
them, and new configurations for other PHP applications can be easily
added.

your own name, ``brale`` user with you own username on your workstation

same as the username).
