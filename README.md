This is a guide on setting up modern web development environment with
PHP on your local Mac or Linux machine, without using any kind of
virtualization. Web server configurations for Symfony, Wordpress and
eZ Platform / Ibexa CMS are provided out of the box, but the setup is
not limited to them, and new configurations for other PHP applications
can be easily added.

Follow the instructions at [https://docs.netgen.io/projects/lds/en/latest/](https://docs.netgen.io/projects/lds/en/latest/).
